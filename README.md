# Final Project Restful Booker Certification II

This code is a part of my final evaluation at university for a subject named Certification II.

It's a simple implementation for a testing automation framework for an API using cucumber, junit and Rest Assured.

#### NOTA
La prueba denominada "post request with /booking endpoint and faulty data must not create an entry #2" is supposed to fail as the API doesn't have the expected result
